# 3D-Globe
3D globe visualization

* The idea behind this is to visualize the clinics and lab. Upon selecting a state, it should show all the clinics and labs. clinics in red dots and labs in blue dots.
* Upon clicking on red dot, it should draw lines to all the labs and those lines should have labels such as number of orders and other details.
* It shall also have a download button to download the data to CSV for further analysis.
